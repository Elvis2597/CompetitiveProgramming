for(int i=1;i<=capacity;i++)

  dp[i]=-1;
}
 It is not correct wrong output 
 for 1
     1 3
     2
 
 Because
 dp[1] will not run 
 and 
 dp[2] will be = value[0](2)+ dp[0] =2
 dp[3]=2+dp[1] = 2-1 =1 wrong
               = 2-0 =2 correct
 Because dp[1] can't be formed so store 0 at that place
 for(int i=1;i<=capacity;i++)
 {
   dp[i]=0;
 }
